# A-Level-Computer-Science-NEA
Non-exam assessment project for AQA A level computer science, developed between September 2017 and April 2018.

### Aims
1. The main focus was getting the maximum number of marks possible for the A level.
2. After this, the project was used to test and make improvements to an application framework library being developed.
